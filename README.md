### Roadmap to Build the Web Server for PSI4 Integration and Scalability

---

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - Define input requirements for PSI4.
   - Identify key outputs users need from PSI4 result files.
   - Define input size limits, response time, and data retention policies.

2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Install PSI4 on your system.
   - Set up Python with Flask/FastAPI for the backend.
   - Install Docker and pull PSI4 image: `docker pull psi4/psi4:1.9.1`.

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Design flow: **Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ PSI4 â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend**.

---

#### **Phase 2: Frontend and Backend MVP**
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Create a simple HTML form to accept user input and file uploads.
   - Use JavaScript (AJAX/Fetch) for form submission.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Create an API endpoint (`/process`) to accept user input.
   - Validate input and generate PSI4 input files dynamically.

3. **PSI4 Integration**
   - Use Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` to run PSI4 with the generated input file.
   - Parse PSI4 output and extract meaningful results.

---

#### **Phase 3: Deployment and Optimization**
1. **Containerization**
   - Create a Docker image for the web server with PSI4.
   - Test locally with Docker Compose.

2. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Deploy the web server to a free cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Fly.io).

3. **Scalability**
   - Implement asynchronous processing with Celery and Redis.
   - Use caching (Redis) for frequently requested results.

4. **Monitoring & Security**
   - Enable logging and basic monitoring.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

---

#### **Final Deliverables**
- Minimal frontend with file upload.
- PSI4 processing backend.
- Deployed Docker container for free cloud hosting.
- Scalable architecture with async processing.

This roadmap ensures a structured and efficient approach to building and deploying your PSI4-based web server. ðŸš€
